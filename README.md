# Planimeter Game Engine 2D
Planimeter Game Engine 2D - LÃ–VE-based game engine for Lua  
(Formerly Grid)

Planimeter Game Engine 2D was designed for multiplayer-first game experiences  
and to bring professional-grade game engine features to the hobbyist community.

It is the most feature-packed game engine you've never heard of, and  
provides more functionality out-of-the-box than most other competing game  
engines.
